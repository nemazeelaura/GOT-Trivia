Game Description:
	Questions pop up one at a time and the user answers them. alert that tells them if right or wrong. You need to answer all questions correct to win.
	final score displayed 

Game functionality:
    The first question is automatically loaded on opening game after answering first question the next one is loaded after clicking one of the answers. The game cycles through the questions until there are none left then the final win or lose outcome is displayed and game can be reset.

    User can reset page to start over


File set up:
I Used three files: index.html, main.css style sheet and main.js javascript file for functionality. I used a contructor object in js to put all the questions and answers in and the correct answer to each ?

things i need to fix - I can't get the index page and game page title and button to match even though they are styled the same. 

*************************
would like to add - shuffle the questions
and better way to store the questions
