Title: GOT-Trivia

Game Description:
	Questions pop up one at a time and the user answers them. alert that tells them if right or wrong. You need to anwer all questions correct to win.

Game functionality:
    The first question is automatically loaded on opening game (working on tieing to click play button)	after answering first question the next one is loaded after clicking one of the answers. The game cycles throught the questions until there are none left then the final win or lose outcome is dosplayed.

    User can refresh page to start over


File set up:
	Used three files: index.html, main.css style sheet and main.js javascript file for functionality

things i need to fix - I can't get the index page and game page title and button to match ven though they are styled the same.

*************************
would like to add - shuffle the questions
